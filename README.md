# AndroidSVG Sample App

A demonstration Android application for the [AndroidSVG library](http://bigbadaboom.github.io/androidsvg/).

----

This app includes example code showing you how to:

- Load an SVG and render it at various sizes to an Andoid [`Canvas`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Canvas).
- Use AndroidSVG's `SVGImageView` custom view class to include SVG images in your layout.
- Re-colour your SVG images at run time using CSS.
- Create simple animations using [`ValueAnimator`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/animation/ValueAnimator).
